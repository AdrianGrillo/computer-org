- Computer components:

1. Processor or CPU 
2. Memory to store both data and programs (list of instructions)
3. Mechanism for data input and output


3 components inside processors:

1. Registers temporarily stores the data inside CPU
2. ALU processes that data (arithmetic logic unit)
3. Control unit interprets instructions and tells ALU what operations to execute through control signals

In what order do these 3 processes happen in? 


- Measures of Capacity

Decimal term
Kilobyte: 10^3 
Megabyte: 10^6
Gigabyte: 10^9
Terabyte: 10^12

CPU speed is measured in MHz or GHz
Hertz is clock cycles per second, there are 1,000,000 hertz in a MHz

Compiler translates high level code to Assembly code and an Assembler translates that assembly code to binary machine code

To code in assembly for this class, we need to download Java and a rars.exe file from github repo called "TheThirdOne" continuous build

Assembly code provides two parts: Data (variables) and Text (instructions)


- Computer Hierarchy:
Levels 0-2 are hardware 
Levels 3-6 are software

6: User - .exe files
5: High level programming - C++, Java
4: Assembly language - Assembly code
3: System software - OS, Library code
2: Machine code - Instruction set architecture
1: Control - Microcode or hardware
0: Digital logic - Circuit Gates


- Von Neumann Model 
Proposed in 1945
memory -> processing unit (ALU) -> control unit

The ALU and control unit have been merged together, now known as the CPU

$ The single data path between the CPU and main memory is known as the Von Neumann Bottleneck

Usually are either 32 or 64 registers in the CPU

Von Neumann Model employs a fetch-decode-execute cycle to run programs

Control unit fetchs instructions from an address in memory then decodes it and sends to ALU, the ALU then executes those instructions


- Program Counter 
A special register that keeps track of which intructions have already been fetched. After  fetching one instruction then it's executed. Now increase pc by one and fetch the next instruction

Since there are a limited number of registers in a CPU, they are a temporary storage for instructions that are cycled out as new instructions are available and old ones are executed

Each intruction in RSC-V requires 4 bytes or 32 bits
