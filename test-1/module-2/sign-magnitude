For SM, the min and max are equal parts negative and positive, so for 4 bits: min is -7 and max is 7
45 = 0010 1101, therefore in signed magnitude we just change the signed bit to one to make it negative and keep the rest so
-45 = 1010 1101


----- Addition and subtraction of SM -----

If signed bits are the same, perform addition. If they're different, perform subtraction. The larger integer always goes on top no matter what the sign is so it would be -4 + 3 


----- PRACTICE -----

Converting a binary to Sign Magnitude

Ex. ------------------
1100 0110

Since the most significant digit represents the sign in SM, the value of the SM representation is the value of the binary representation minus 128. 

1100 0110 = 198
198 - 128 = 70

Since the most significant bit is 1, the value is negative

1100 0110 = -70 in SM


Ex. ------------------
53 and -53

Convert to binary first 
53 = 0011 0101
53 in binary is the same as 53 in SM

To find -53, simply make the most significant digit a 1
-53 = 1011 0101

Ex. ------------------
1011 1100
SM = -60
