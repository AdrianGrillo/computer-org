For SM, the min and max and equal parts negative and positive, so for 4 bits: min is -7 and max is 7
45 = 0010 1101, therefore in sign magnitude we just change the signed bit to one to make it negative and keep the rest so
-45 = 1010 1101


----- Addition and subtraction of SM -----

If signed bits are the same, perform addition. If they're different, perform subtraction. The larger integer always goes on top no matter what the sign is so it would be -4 +3 


----- PRACTICE -----

Converting a binary to Sign Magnitude

1100 0110
SM = -70

53 and -53
SM = 0011 0101 and 1011 0100 - To go negative, flip the sign bit only

1011 1100
SM = -60
