Computers can only process binary numbers. Hex and octal is for human communication of these complex binary numbers.


Decimal - Our regular number system, Radix = 10
01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11


Binary - Computer number system, Radix = 2
0,  1,  2,  3,  4,   5,   6,   7,   8
00, 01, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000


Octal - Goes from 0-7, so 10 represents 8, Radix = 8
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 10 = 1 * 8
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 17 = 1 * 8 + 7
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27

Now the 2 in the octal system represents 16 or 2*8


Hexidecimal - Goes from 0-15. So far, the most confusing of the bunch, Radix = 16
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, F = 15

10 = 1 * 16
11 = 1 * 16 + 1 

1C
1D
1E = 1 * 16 + 14
1F = 1 * 16 + 15

20 = 2 * 16 + 0

Binary to Octal 

When converting binary to octal and hex, each group of 3 0 and 1's is considered one digit

Start grouping from decimal to the left and decimal to the right

If for the ending group there aren'y exactly 3 digits, just add 0 at the beginning and it represents the same value


Binary to Hex

Groups are 4 digits of binary

The same applies if there aren't enough digits for a group, just add zeros before the values until it makes a group of 4 and it will represent the same value
