1's Complement, like SM, also uses the most signigicant digit to represent the sign of the integer

If you perform addition for two of the same integer no matter the sign, you always get 1111, example:
-2 is 1101 and 2 is 0010 SO -2 + 2 = 1111 and this pattern continues for all integers

However a postive decimal value is represented in binary format, the negative version is represented with all of the bits flipped in 1's complement. Example

4 = 0100, -4 = 1011

And this pattern continues for every number 

-45 = 11010010

The problem with 1's complement is that there's a -0: 1111 and 0: 0000, if you're adding and cross this bar, you must perform an additional addition to get the right answer


Addition and subtraction of 1's Compliment
-4 + (-3): when you get to left most bit in addition, it's 10111 so you carry the one over and eventually get 1000

When subtracting in 1's complement, you still perform binary addition and eventually carry


----- PRACTICE -----

Ex. ------------------
Converting a binary to 1's Complement
Binary: 1100 0110

Flip all of the bits -> 1's Complement: 0011 1001

0011 1001 = 57 

So even though the binary value is 198, the 1's Complement is 57


Ex. ------------------
53 and -53

1's Complement of 53 and binary of 53 is going to be the same because it's a positive value

53 Binary & 1's Complement: 0011 0101

To get -53, simply flip all of the bits

-53 1's Complement: 1100 1010


Ex. ------------------
What is this value in 1's Complement?
1011 1100

If you have a vale in 1's complement and want to find the decimal representation, flip all of the bits except for the signed bits and now it's in binary. Once it's in binary you can look at the decimal representation of the binary value.

Binary: 1 100 0011

1's Compliment = -67
