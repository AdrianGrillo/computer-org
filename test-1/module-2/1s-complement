1's Complement, like SM, also uses the most signigicant digit to represent the sign of the integer

If you perform addition for two values, you always get 1111, example:
-2 is 1101 and 2 is 0010 SO -2 + 2 = 1111 and this pattern continues for all integers

Whatever the postiive decimal is represented as a signed number in binary, the negative value is represented with all of the inverse numbers. Example

-4 = 1011, 4 = 0100  

And this pattern continues for every number 

-45 = 11010010

The problem with 1's complement is that there's a -0: 1111 and 0: 0000, if you're adding and cross this bar, you must perform an additional addition to get the right answer


Addition and subtraction of 1's Compliment
-4 + (-3): when you get to left most bit in addition, it's 10111 so you carry the one over and eventually get 1000

When subtracting in 1's complement, you still perform binary addition and eventually carry


----- PRACTICE -----

Converting a binary to 1's Complement
Original 1100 0110

1's Complement - Negative because everything is changed 
0011 1001
-57

53 and -53
1's Compliment = 0011 0101 and 1100 1010 - To go negative, flip all of the bits

1011 1100
1's Compliment = -67
