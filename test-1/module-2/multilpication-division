----- MULTIPLICATION -----

- Left Arithmetic Shift: Insert a 0 for the right most bit and shifts everything else left by one bit.
This in effect multiplies by 2

When mutiplying, the most significant digit is moved to be the least significant digit, example: 

0001 * 2 = 0010 -> The left most zero is removed from the beginning and placed on the end 

1101 * 2 = 1010


----- DIVISION -----

- Right Arithmetic Shift: Inset the signed bit as the most significant digit
