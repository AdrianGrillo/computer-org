Two different patterns for fetching blocks of memory from main memory and from cached memory.

From main: 6 bits, 3 for block address and 3 for block offset

From cache: 6 bits, 1 tag, 2 block index, 3 for offset 
Cache has a tag because two blocks from main memory can be mapped to a single block in cached.
Refer to slide 3 on 6.4 part 1


Ex. 
Consider a cache with 256 blocks with a block size of 16 bytes

1. Pattern for main memory
32 total bits with first 28 being block address with last 4 being offset

2. Pattern for cache
32 total bits, 20 bits for tag, 8 bits for index, 4 bits for offset 
8 bit cache index b/c 2^8 = 256 blocks
4 bit offset b/c 2^4 = 16 bytes per block

These patterns will change depending on the amount of blocks in main memory and bytes per block 

There is also a valid bit to the left of the tagged bit to determine if the data is valid or not.
When the computer first starts, all of the valid bits are 0. After loading some data from main memory, these valid bits will be 1 for as long as the computer runs b/c there will always be data in the cache.
