If the valid bit is one, the frame is stored in PM
If the valid bit is zero, it's a page fault 

Pages refer to virtual memory while frames refer to physical memory.

1 page = 1kb and 1024 addresses

6.4 Slide 4 for how the addresses are set up as far as page/ frames and offset

VM has 13 bits in the address, 3 for page and 10 for offset
PM has 12 bits, 2 for frame and 10 for offset 

Know how to calculate effective access time 

Going from smallest to largest
Cache -> PM -> VM

CPU provides the virtual address that is then translated to a physical address. Then Cache memory checks the PM for addresses. 
 
If a page fault doesn't occur, the page is stored in the hard disk and physical memory.
If it does occur, then the page is only stored on the hard disk. 

If there isn't a page fault, from there we check the cache and its either a hit or a miss. 

Translation look aside buffer (TLB) is a special cache that stores the mapping of virtual pages to physical pages. So a virtual page number mapping to a page number. 

Cache: 1ns
Memory: 200ns
Hard disk: 10ms

1. TLB hit -> 1ns + 200ns 

2. TLB miss -> check page table for a valid bit. 
If a valid bit is found then the data is both on the hard disk and the physical memory. 
200ns to access page table, 200ns to read data from PM
200ns + 200ns + 1ns

3. TLB miss -> If valid bit is not found on page table then the data isn't on PM so it has to access the hard disk. 
Load page from HD, update TLB, update page table with valid bit
