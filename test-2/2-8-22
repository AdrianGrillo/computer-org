xyz' => 110 
digit with the apostrophe is a 0 and represents not

x   y   z   f(x,y,z)    Minterm
0   0   0   1           x'y'z' = m0
0   0   1   1           x'y'z = m1
0   1   0   0          
0   1   1   1           x'yz = m3
1   0   0   0           
1   0   1   0        
1   1   0   1           xyz' = m6
1   1   1   0        

1st case -> not x, not y, not z -> output is 1

Cases where f(x,y,z) is true: 
x'y'z' || x'y'z || x'yz || xyz' 
m0 + m1 + m3 + m4
m(0, 1, 3, 4)


x   y   z   f(x,y,z)    Minterm
0   0   0   0           
0   0   1   1           x'y'z
0   1   0   0          
0   1   1   1           x'yz
1   0   0   1           xy'z'
1   0   1   1           xy'z
1   1   0   0   
1   1   1   1           xyz

m(1, 3, 4, 5, 7)

Sum of products form: xy + yz + xy
Products of sums form: (x + z)(x + y)(y + z)


----- Boolean Identities -----

To simplify boolean function, remove the redundant information using boolean identities

Boolean identities on slide 7 chapter 3 module 1 powerpoint

3 variables and 2 operations ->  Strong hint to use Distributive Law 

2 variables and 2 operations -> Strong hint to use Absorbtion Law

yz = y AND z, a product indicates the AND operator

y + z = y OR z, a sum indicates the OR operator


On the module 3 homework, for each step make a comment on which identity is being applied at each step
