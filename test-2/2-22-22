Slide 11

1. Mark all feedback signals

QA(t), QA(t)', QB(t)'

J = X xor QA(t)
K = (J + QB(t)')'
D = (KQA(t)')'

2. Apply the characteristic table of flip flops to obtain the flip flops next states 

QA(t+1) is found according to the properties of JK flip flop
J and K = 0 -> No change 
J = 0 and K = 1 -> Reset to 0
J = 1 and K = 0 -> Set to 1
J and K = 1 -> Negate  QA(t)

QB(t+1) is determined by the properties of D flip flop

X   QA(t)   QB(t)   J   K   D   QA(t+1) QB(t+1)
0   0       0       0   0   1   0       1
0   0       1       0   1   0   0       0
0   1       0       1   0   1   1       1
0   1       1       1   0   1   1       1
1   0       0       1   0   1   1       1
1   0       1       1   0   1   1       1
1   1       0       0   0   1   1       1
1   1       1       0   1   1   0       1


Sequential circuits can also be called Finite State Machines (FSM)

In a sequential circuit with p flip flops, you can have 2^p distinct states

There are two types of finite machines: Mealy and Moore machines


----- Moore Machine -----

Outputs are a function of the current state

Output changes synchronously with state changes


----- Mealy Machine -----

Outputs depend on state and on inputs

Output is not synchronized with current state because it is also dependent on external inputs 


On slide 14 the bottom diagram is the Mealy machine because it takes A and B as external inputs that don't go through flip flops


RISC V Base Architecture Components

Program counter, register file, arithmetic logic unit, and main memory

The memory address is represented by 32 bits unsigned, this means that there are 2^32 total addresses 

In hex address each digit is 4 bits and there are 8 digits so hex has 2^32 total addresses 

Byte addressible means 8 bits per address 

Each address stores 1 byte so capacity of the whole system is 2^32 bytes which is 4 GB because a GB is 2^30

There are 32 total registers x0 through x31. Each register stores a 32 bit word so 5 bits are needed to store a name of the register 

register 0 is 00000
register 32 is 11111
