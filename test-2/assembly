----- Conditionals -----

If statements are always broken down into two parts. 

Example -> Use Module 4 Assignment 1

cmp t0, t1      // Compare the values in these two registers
jge larger      // If t0 is >= t1, jump to larger branch
sub t2, t0, t1


larger:         // Execute these instructions if t0 >= t1
