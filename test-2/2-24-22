Need java to run the executible jar file

ALU can't read instructions directly from memory, only from registers

Arithmetic: Mathimatic operations

Logical: And, inclusive/ exclusive or

Shift: 
If arithmetic shift right -> insert 1 to MSD
If logical shift right -> insert 0 to MSD

If arithmetic or logic shift left -> insert 0 to LSD


Each set of instructions is 32 bits and each group of bits represents some different part of the instruction

Opcode determines what type of instruction
Function 3 determines if arithmetic, logic, or shift
Function 7 determines if add or sub

** Go over the different instruction types like R, J, I
